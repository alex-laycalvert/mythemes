# mythemes

This is a small collection of some basic system themes I've made.

Because this is custom to my setup, the following application themes are configured to change when the theme is change:

-   qtile (Window Manager)
-   neovim (Text Editor)
-   kitty (Terminal)
-   starship (Prompt)
-   wallpaper (Using nitrogen)
